# Worldwind config fragment

This fragment is added at runtime to the gov.nasa.worldwind bundle, adding its *customconfig* folder to the available resources.
The *customconfig* folder's content is then available as alternative configuration setup.
This way, config can be easily changed, by just replacing this fragment.
